**Overall:**
Great work! No suggestions from me thus far. While it sounds like you are familiar with some of the modeling techniques that we are going to discuss soon in class, take some time to dive into some of the fundamentals of machine learning!

_If you would like some extra material to get ahead, let me know!_

**A quick note on Jupyter Notebooks**  
I noticed that you put all of your notes/answers into one cell block. This is totally fine, but for the future feel free to mix in some code, plots, and math (_via latex like expressions_) in the notebooks too.
